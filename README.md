This is a personal project I'm building as a cybersecurity student who wants to make studying more effective and less overwhelming. Since everyone is always on thier phones I wanted to create an app that would improve one's knowledge of cybersecurity instead of scrolling mindlessly on social media. Most apps cost on the app store, at least for the better qualiity apps. The goal of this app is to use AI to help students prepare for popular cybersecurity certifications like Security+, CEH, and CISSP for free and for the benefit of them and them only. Instead of just memorizing flashcards, this tool will use intelligent questioning, explanations, and even study plans to help students understand the concepts better.

I'm building this project to improve my own skills in cybersecurity, software development, and working with AI. I also hope it helps others who are on the same path.

This project is still in early stages, but I will continue documenting every step, including the APIs and tools I use and any issues I run into. That way, others can learn from my progress or even contribute.

This is a concept for an app that uses AI software to create flashcards, practice questions, and exams on an app for cyber students to study for certifications at the tip of their fingers.
